    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Cloud Computing. Currently exploring the world of web development, I have a foundational understanding and am eager to dive deeper into tech. My academic journey is just beginning, but I’m setting clear goals: after completing my B.Tech, I plan to work for a couple of years to gain hands-on experience before pursuing an M.Tech to further deepen my expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of studies, I enjoy immersing myself in manga, anime, and even Beyblade battles! Though I’m an introvert by nature, I’m determined and capable when given the right steps and information to solve problems. My interest in structured problem-solving aligns well with my technical field, and I’m constantly motivated to improve my skills and knowledge. Each new step in my education brings me closer to achieving my vision in the tech world

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
        I have a deep interest in manga, anime, and the thrill of Beyblade battles. Immersing myself in these worlds offers a unique escape and fuels my creativity. Manga and anime provide endless stories and characters that inspire me, while Beyblade brings out a competitive side, allowing me to engage in exciting, strategic battles. These hobbies give me a break from academics and add a playful, imaginative element to my routine.
