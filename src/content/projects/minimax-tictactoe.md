Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game, where I’ve implemented the Minimax algorithm to create a challenging AI opponent. This AI carefully evaluates every move, aiming to play optimally and make the game as competitive as possible. The interface is simple and distraction-free, letting you jump right into the strategy of the game. Test your skills and see if you can outsmart the algorithm—good luck!
